Project Summary
This Scouting & Recruitment Dashboard was developed using Streamlit to provide an interactive, data-driven platform for analyzing football player statistics. The application loads player data from a CSV file (top5-players.csv) stored locally and displays it in a clean, filter-ready interface. Key components include:

Environment Setup: Python virtual environment creation and installation of essential libraries (Streamlit, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly).
Data Ingestion: Loading and caching the CSV data to ensure fast performance.
User Interface: A sidebar reserved for future filtering options and a main area displaying the dataset in table format.
Future Enhancements: Plans include adding interactive filtering, advanced visualizations, and eventually integrating live data from football APIs.
This project serves as a foundational stage for a comprehensive scouting tool that will support data-driven decisions in football recruitment.
